# Ecosystem-Contributed dApps & Tools
> [!NOTE]  
> 🔹 = Official Midnight Ecosystem Partner

## 🔦 Ecosystem dApp of the Month!  
A part of the Midnight LATAM Hackathon, [KYC Midnight](https://github.com/joacolinares/kyc-midnight) is a privacy-preserving KYC attestation dApp on the Midnight network. It verifies user eligibility—such as age and country—using zero-knowledge proofs without revealing personal data on-chain. The project ships with both a web UI and a CLI, includes admin-managed policy controls, and is testnet-ready—making it a practical template for compliant, privacy-first onboarding flows.  
The open-source code is available on GitHub, encouraging collaboration and further development.
